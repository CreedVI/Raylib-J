# Raylib-J Roadmap

This is a rough outline of how I want to progress the library. If you want to help out hitting these major bullet points 
would be an excellent way to do so. Otherwise, consider helping out with bug hunting/squishing or contributing to the 
[examples repo](https://github.com/CreedVI/Raylib-J-Examples)!
