# Raylib-J
A handmade version of Raylib for Java.

<hr>
<div>
  
**Raylib-J is still in early development.**<br>
Raylib-J is a handwritten binding of <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib">Raylib</a> in Java using 
<a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL3</a> to provide the OpenGL framework. 



**Raylib-J is being built based on the 3.7 release of Raylib**<br>
Raylib-J is meant to be a one-for-one rewrite of Raylib with some quality of life changes including, but not limited 
to: JavaDoc comments, `DrawFPS(int posX, int posY, Color theColorYouWant)`, and `CloseWindow()` being handled 
automatically!

## Message from the dev:
<div>
I am being deployed at this time. While pushes to the repo will be infrequent I will continue to work on this project 
offline as I am able to find the time. Any pull requests made at this time may sit for a while as I may not have the ability
to review them. 

Until my return,<br>
CreedVI
